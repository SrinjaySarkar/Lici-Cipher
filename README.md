# Lici-Cipher
This repository contains the C code as well as the embedded C code for using the LiCi cipher as a plain C application and on the ARM based LPC2148   
I also added the code for the ANU cipher
The LiCi cipher is based on the IEEE paper:http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7977007/
The ANU cipher is based on the paper:http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sec.1692/full
